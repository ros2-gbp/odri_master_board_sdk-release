## Ordering Instructions
<img src="../images/master_board_delivery_1.jpg" width="500"><br>*Master Boards as delivered by BetaLayout.*<br>

We have been ordering the Master Boards from [BetaLayout](https://us.beta-layout.com/pcb/).
Beta Layout has the permission to replicate our MasterBoard v2 order for anybody who is interested - they ship worldwide.

Send an email to info.de@beta-layout.com and ask for a quote for replicating the Master Board v2 order according to the quote number **AN5eea24ae72697**. Specify the desired quantity and your location.

BetaLayout will send you a quote for producing the boards and for the placing and soldering service *- NOT including the cost of the electronic components.*

After you have placed the order for the boards Beta Layout will search for the components and will send you the component list with the actual component prices for your approval. For our last orders the component price was around 35€ per board.

We order the boards with all the components placed and soldered - except for the Ethernet jack and the NeoPixel leds. The soldering of those components is described [below](#preparing-the-master-board). The NeoPixel leds are very useful for visual status feedback but are not required to operate the Master Board.
